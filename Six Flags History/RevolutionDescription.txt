Revolution opened in 1976 at Magic Mountain with the name "Great American Revolution".  The year 1976 was the United State's 200th anniversary. It was also widely known as being the first modern coaster to contain a complete vertical loop.  The name was changed in 1979 to "La Revoluci√≥n" to fit the area's new Mexican theme when Six Flags purchased the park. The name was finally changed to "Revolution" in 1988.
