Magic Flyer originally opened at Beverly Park around 1946.  It stayed there until 1971 when it opened along with Magic Mountain with the name "Clown Coaster".  It remained with this name until the 1984 offseason.  In the offseason of 1984, the ride was rethemed and renamed to "Wile E. Coyote Coaster" to suit the theme of Bugs World.  Again it remained like this until the ride closed in 1998.  It was to be rethemed again to look like a minature version of the new coaster Goliath.  In 2001, the ride reopened with the name "Goliath Junior".  In the 2007 offseason, the ride was rethemed to match the new kid's zone called Thomas Town.  It reopened in 2008 with the name "Percy's Railway".  It remained this way until in 2010 when Six Flags removed the license it had made that allowed them to theme attractions from Thomas.  As a result, the ride was renamed "Magic Flyer" and the Thomas characters were removed from the ride.

Magic Flyer is a kiddy coaster.  After leaving the station, the ride ascends a 10-foot chain lift hill.  Then the coaster brings you down the hill and 180 degrees to the left.  Then there is a second dip followed by another 180 degrees turn which brings the car back to the station.
