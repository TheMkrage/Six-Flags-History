Gold Rusher opened in 1971 along with the rest of the park.  It was the park's first coaster, making it historical.  Originally, it was painted red, but after Magic Mountain's first season, the ride was painted gold.  Nothing has really been changed about this coaster since it opened in 1971.  Since Six Flags has added more extreme coasters to the park, Gold Rusher is now advertised as a family ride.
